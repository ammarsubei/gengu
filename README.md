# GENGU

### WORK IN PROGRESS

Simple 2D platformer written in C++11 using SFML. It's supposed to be a primitive platformer about a ninja character named Gengu (based off of Overwatch's Genji). Gengu can throw shurikens (3 at a time), double jump, wall run, slash with a sword, and deflect projectiles with his sword. Gengu is essentially Genji from Overwatch, just dumber and clumsier.
